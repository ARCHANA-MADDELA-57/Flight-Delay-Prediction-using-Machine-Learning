**Introduction**

--This project focuses on predicting flight delays using machine learning algorithms. The models are trained and evaluated using historical flight data to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not based on various features such as departure time, arrival time, carrier information, weather conditions, etc.

**Dataset**

--The dataset used in this project is sourced from flight_data.csv . It includes historical flight data in CSV format, containing features relevant to flight delays.

**Techniques Used**

--Data preprocessing and cleaning

--Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

--Feature selection and engineering

--Machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for classification

--Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

**Files Included**

--Flight_Delay_Prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

--requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies required to run the notebook.

**Usage:**

--Open and run the Jupyter notebook Flight_Delay_Prediction.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

--Follow the notebook cells sequentially to execute data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

**Results**

--Describe the performance of each model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

--Discuss insights gained from EDA and feature importance.

--Include visualizations  to illustrate model performance.
